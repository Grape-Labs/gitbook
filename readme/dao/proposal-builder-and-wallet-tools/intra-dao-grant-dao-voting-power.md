# Intra DAO: Grant DAO Voting Power

This plugin is extremely useful for DAOs that would like to Grant more voting power to new or existing members in a DAO, this is not limited to the same DAO but can be on any DAO using the SPL Governance Program (non-VSR setup)

Visit the Treasury and expand the menu for the DAO Wallet you would like to make the proposal with, select Create Proposal to get started

The Create Proposal Prompt will appear and you can populate a title, description, change the Governance Wallet, and set the Proposal Instructions you would like to add

Once this instruction has been selected, the instruction setup section will appear, this will allow you to first set which DAO you would like to Grant the voting power for (note that you will need to be holding the token in the governance wallet selected in order to grant voting power)

If this is within the same DAO that the wallet is in, you can press on the following icon to quickly set the DAO address

Once the DAO address has been selected the Governance UI will check if the DAO is valid and then bring up the available community and council tokens, along with a token selection dropdown

The token selection dropdown will show only the tokens held in the DAO wallet, as those will be granted to the recipients

The Destination text area supports adding a single wallet by entering that wallet here, or alternatively adding a comma or tab delimited text (i.e. from a CSV or Excel) that will have the following two fields per column:

* Destination Wallet PublicKey
* Amount of Tokens to send

If there is no second column but only PublicKeys then the Amount field will be used, and you can use the helper buttons above to set if you would like the amount to be distributed evenly
