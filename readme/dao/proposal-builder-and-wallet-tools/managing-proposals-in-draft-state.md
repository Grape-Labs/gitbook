# Managing Proposals in Draft State

## Viewing Proposal Settings & Draft Tools&#x20;

Proposals that are in a Draft state are those that have been created but not signed off, the sign off process is the last step of the proposal creation, the lifespan of the proposal is:

* Selecting Rules Wallet to create the proposal from
* Populating the Title & Description
* Sending the proposal on chain for creation
* Inserting Instructions
* Signing Off Proposal (updating state/status from Draft to Voting)
* After a proposal has been signed off it is in a voting state, the voting period is defined by the rules wallet
* At the end of the proposal and successful completion (passing the voting threshold defined by the rules wallet) the proposal can be executed, if there are instructions those can be executed accordingly at this time

To manage a proposal while it is in a draft state in governance.so visit the proposal that the wallet you have connected has created the proposal with. Then go to the right of the proposal and press the "More Info" button to expand the proposal rules & options

## Signing Off a proposal

Signing off a proposal will change the status from a Draft state to a Voting state, this will start the voting process where the council or community members can participate in this proposal, a signed off proposal will not allow instructions to be added or removed and cannot add additional signers

## Adding a Signer

This will allow more signers to sign off a proposal, this scenario is ideal for groups of individuals that need to review a proposal before it is put for a vote, after all have signed off then the proposal is in voting state and the community and council can vote for the proposal accordingly

## Cancelling a Proposal

Proposals that are in a draft state can be easily cancelled using the Cancel button, this will also check if there are any instructions associated with the proposal and if there are any instructions prompt to inform the user that they can remove those instructions to claim back rent for the instructions

## Adding Instructions to a proposal

While in a Draft state, the proposal author (wallet that has created the proposal) can at any time add more instructions, to do so in governance.so press the Draft button in this menu to bring up the proposal editor

## Removing Instructions from a Draft

If a proposal is in a Draft state and has instructions, expand those instructions in the UI. There will be a red delete icon (trash icon), and clicking this will allow you to remove the instruction and claim back the rent allocated for this instruction, this is very useful in case instructions are large and need to be reviewed and an error has occured during the creation of the proposal. _Note that if the proposal is not in the Draft state instructions cannot be added or removed_
