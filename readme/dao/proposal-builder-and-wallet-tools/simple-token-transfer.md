This will bring up the Send Extension which allows you to send Tokens or SOL quickly and easily, here you can set the token (or change it) the amount to send, and the recipient, there is a quick person icon that allows you to populate the connected wallet address

Once the amount and recipient is filled out, on the lower section the Advanced and Send buttons will appear

Pressing the Advanced button will bring up additional settings for the proposal that will be created, and here you can see the auto completed title and description which are both editable. You can also adjust if the proposal is for the Council or Community and if the proposal will be a Draft (not signed off), pressing the Send button will create the proposal and will be ready for voting it is not in a Draft State

If the propsal is in a Draft state it can be easily signed off at any time it is ready to be put for voting
