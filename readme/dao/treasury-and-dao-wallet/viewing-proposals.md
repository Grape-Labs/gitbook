# Viewing Proposals

Proposals in Governance are created per DAO Wallet, each wallet has a set of rules which are followed for the respective wallet, allowing the proposal to interact with the wallet holdings for the respective instructions. To view the proposals, click on the arrows on the lower left menu, this will expand the wallet view to show all proposal titles with a brief summary including:

* Title
* Status
* Date the proposal was drafted

Each proposal can be quickly expanded by clicking on the caret button on the right above the date, this will expands the proposal to show further information including:

* Voting direction (Yes/No) in percentages
* The remaining time
* The proposal description with support for embedded gist rendering

Beyond the quick expanding, there is another expand button which will expand the proposal to bring up a dialog with the full [proposal details](../../../governance-ui/dao/proposals/proposal-details.md) & this will allow a participant to vote and interact with a proposal from this prompt&#x20;
