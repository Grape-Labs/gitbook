# About

## Overview

`Governance.so` is a Solana governance interface focused on:

* DAO discovery and monitoring
* proposal review and voting
* treasury operations
* governance automation via extensions
* member and participation analytics

Current app version in `package.json`: `1.2.10`.

***

### What We Have Built

#### Core product capabilities

* Governance directory with verified DAO metadata support (GSPL + GraphQL merge).
* Full DAO view with proposal list, search, and state filters.
* Rich proposal detail view with voting actions, proposal metadata, and instruction management.
* Treasury wallet views with value aggregation, per-wallet drill-down, and execution tooling.
* Member analytics and participation tables.
* Realtime proposal/event feed.
* Wallet profile view (participation, created proposals, vote history, SNS domains).
* Extension framework for governance, treasury, DeFi, identity, and IntraDAO actions.

#### Platform capabilities

* Solana wallet adapter integration (`Phantom`, `Solflare`, `Ledger`).
* Dynamic RPC/cluster switching from UI (Mainnet/Devnet + custom endpoint).
* PWA install support and service worker update strategy.
* Push notification registration + foreground/background handling.
* Embed routes for governance and proposal widgets.

***

### UI Architecture

#### Global app shell

* Main shell is rendered in `src/App.tsx`.
* Top navigation + drawer lives in `src/Header/Header.tsx`.
* Main content is route-driven with React Router v6.

#### Header and drawer

Header provides:

* app branding
* wallet connect button
* RPC settings dialog
* PWA install button (when browser supports install prompt)

Left drawer provides:

* `Directory` (`/`)
* `Profile` (`/profile`) when wallet connected
* `Realtime` (`/realtime`)
* external docs link
* governance quick search/autocomplete

### Configuration and Feature Gating

Key runtime/config gates in the current UI:

* `REACT_APP_SOLANA_CLUSTER`: default network cluster
* `APP_SANCTUM_API_KEY`: shows Sanctum swap extension in menu
* `REACT_APP_API_METRICS_TOKEN` (`METRICS_TOKEN`): enables gated metrics access flow
* Firebase env variables + VAPID key: required for push registration and delivery
