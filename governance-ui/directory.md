# Directory

The Governance Directory was created to serve as a comprehensive hub for active DAOs within the Solana ecosystem utilizing SPL Governance. It provides real-time updates on the latest activities, offers summary metrics for each active DAO, and features an extensive list of DAOs for users to explore. This directory is designed to be a valuable resource, enabling users to easily stay informed about governance activities and discover new DAOs within the Solana network.
