# Delegation

Delegation is important if you would like another wallet holder to vote on your behalf, this is very useful if you have a mobile device with a different wallet that you would like to vote while on the go, or if you have a colleague or friend who will be voting on your behalf if you are not available to participate in a proposal. If you are a DAO participant, delegation is very simple on governance.so

* Connect your wallet
* Navigate to the DAO you are participating in
* From this page clicking on the gear (cogs) icon will bring up the Advanced Voting Power prompt
* Here you can view your voting power and delegate the votes so another wallet (PublicKey) can vote on your behalf for any proposal

## Viewing & Removing Delegate

To remove the delegate, again navigate to the Advanced Voting Power prompt and there you can see the PublicKey that has been delegated to, clicking on the delete icon will send a transaction to the blockchain to remove the delegate, after removing the delegate then you can add a different one
