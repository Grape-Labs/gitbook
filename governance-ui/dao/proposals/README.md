# Proposals

The DAO Dashboard allows you to effortlessly navigate to any DAO and view all their active proposals. From this page, you can access valuable metrics at the top, including the total votes cast, the proposal success rate, and detailed information on passing and defeated proposals, offering a quick overview of the DAO's health. Below, you'll find a list of active proposals, enhanced with a convenient search feature that scans both proposal titles and descriptions. Proposals highlighted in white text are currently active, while those greyed out have been completed. Clicking on any proposal will open the [Proposal Details Prompt](proposal-details.md) for specific proposal details and to participate in the proposal.
