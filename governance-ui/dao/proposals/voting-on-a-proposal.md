# Voting on a Proposal

To vote on a proposal first make sure that you have connected your wallet with voting power, then visit the proposal or governance address and open up the respective proposal that is up for voting

If your wallet is connected but the Voting Options are greyed out then you are not qualified to vote for this proposal because either you do not have the respective voting tokens deposited to vote for the proposal or the proposal voting period has not begun (draft state) or has completed
