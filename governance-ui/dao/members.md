# Members

To view members of a token-based or council-type DAO, visit the specific DAO you are interested in exploring. Then, navigate to the Members Tab, where you'll find a list of the respective DAO members along with their voting power. This feature allows you to easily see who is involved in the DAO and the influence each member holds in decision-making processes. To filter out specific wallet addresses you can click on the header column to expand a menu with viewing and searching options.
