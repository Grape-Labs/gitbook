# Metrics

Grape has developed the most advanced DAO metrics within the Solana ecosystem, offering unparalleled insights into both overall DAO participation and detailed individual wallet activity. These metrics, which were previously difficult to access, provide DAOs with a comprehensive view of their community's engagement at any given time. This powerful tool enables DAOs to monitor and understand their members' participation with exceptional clarity, ensuring informed decision-making and fostering a more connected and active community.
