# Metrics

Grape has developed the most advanced DAO metrics within the Solana ecosystem, offering unparalleled insights into both overall DAO participation and detailed individual wallet activity. These metrics, which were previously difficult to access, provide DAOs with a comprehensive view of their community's engagement at any given time. This powerful tool enables DAOs to monitor and understand their members' participation with exceptional clarity, ensuring informed decision-making and fostering a more connected and active community.

## Viewing DAO Participation Rewards

DAO Governance Rewards can be seen in comparison to the current selected filter and there is a quick and convenient column for all time rewards, so you can easily identify the period rewards and all time rewards in a single export, DAO Governance Rewards measures both token transfers for the respective proposal participation, along with more complex direct granting of DAO voting power

Furthermore the table allows you to identify each instance of transfered and granted power that is measured in these metrics by hovering over the respective row in the Awarded column &#x20;
