# Dashboard

The Vine Token was crafted as a reputation tool specifically designed to reward users participating in the Discord server, effectively bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 by measuring and recognizing active engagement. During each designated epoch, a new token will be issued, resetting participation and allowing users to continuously build and maintain their reputation. This system ensures that contributions are consistently acknowledged, encouraging ongoing involvement and fostering a thriving, engaged community.
