# About

Purpose: VINE was created to track and incentivize active participation within the Grape DAO

Objective : To create a fair, transparent system for rewarding contributions and enhancing engagement ( Can also add extra explanation that it is a fair way of those who participate at later stages/ new user friendly etc.)&#x20;

## **The Need for VINE**

Tracks call participation activity, monitors the frequency and level of activity (S,A,P)&#x20;

## **How was it implemented**

**See** [**Repository**](repository.md)

## **How & when are tokens allocated**

(twice) weekly with the activity level explained above. This regular allocation helps maintain engagement and rewards continuous participatiom&#x20;

## **Points of attention:**

* Current system requires manual handling and relies on specific dao members for operation. This could be discussed for further automation to reduce dependancy for better scalability.
