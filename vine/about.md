# About

## Purpose

VINE was created to track and incentivize active participation within the Grape DAO

## Objective

The Vine Token was established to foster a fair and transparent system that not only rewards contributions but also enhances community engagement. By ensuring equitable recognition for every participant's efforts, the Vine Token aims to cultivate a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem where contributions are valued, and active involvement is encouraged. Through this innovative approach, the Vine Token seeks to empower individuals and strengthen the bonds within the community, driving collective growth and success.

## Solution

Tracks call participation activity, monitors the frequency and level of activity (S,A,P)&#x20;

### **How was it implemented**

### **How & when are tokens allocated**

(twice) weekly with the activity level explained above. This regular allocation helps maintain engagement and rewards continuous participatiom&#x20;

### **Points of attention:**

* Current system requires manual handling and relies on specific dao members for operation. This could be discussed for further automation to reduce dependancy for better scalability.
