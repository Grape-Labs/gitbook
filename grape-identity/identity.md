# Identity

Identity is Grape's wallet operations console for Solana incident response, transaction safety, approvals cleanup, and holdings intelligence.

### Routes

* Primary console: `/identity`
* Public, read-only holdings view: `/identity/[publickey]`

### What Identity Includes

Identity currently ships these modules in the Wallet Console:

1. Transact + Simulation
2. Approval Risk Scanner
3. Incident Response Mode
4. Address Book + Labels
5. Delegate Explorer
6. Signer + Authority Map
7. Staking
8. Signature Decoder
9. Rent Recovery Sweeper
10. Program Buffers
11. Claim Round Manager
12. Holdings
13. Jupiter Swap Router (optional, feature-flagged)

### Core Controls

#### Wallet and RPC

* Connect/disconnect via Solana Wallet Adapter (Phantom, Solflare).
* Switch RPC between:
  * Shyft (default)
  * Solana Mainnet Beta
  * Solana Devnet
  * Custom RPC URL
* RPC preference is persisted in local storage.

#### Identity Security Policy

* Profiles: `Conservative`, `Balanced` (default), `Aggressive`.
* Policy selection changes how Identity Security Score is weighted.
* Inputs include:
  * External delegates
  * External close authorities
  * NFT delegate exposure

### Module Details

#### 1) Transact + Simulation

Supported action modes:

* Send SOL
* Send SPL token (creates destination ATA when missing)
* Burn token
* Close empty token account
* Metaplex full burn (legacy NFT flow)

Preflight tools:

* Transaction simulation before send
* Instruction breakdown (program, accounts, data length)
* Token deltas
* Rent impact
* Fee estimate
* Runtime logs
* Risk flags
* Failure hints (ATA mismatch, authority mismatch, frozen account, etc.)

#### 2) Approval Risk Scanner

* Scores token accounts based on delegate/close-authority exposure.
* Highlights high-risk rows first.
* Supports:
  * Revoke single delegate
  * Revoke all delegates (batched)
* Handles Token Program and Token-2022.
* Frozen delegated accounts are detected and skipped with warnings.

#### 3) Incident Response Mode

Builds and executes a containment workflow to a safe wallet.

Selectable operations:

* Revoke delegates
* Sweep SPL tokens
* Sweep SOL (minus reserve)
* Rotate close authorities (when wallet controls authority)
* Rotate mint/freeze authorities (for mints the wallet controls)

Behavior:

* Generates a plan summary before execution.
* Executes in transaction batches.
* Collects confirmed signatures and per-batch failures.
* Supports deep-link presets through query params (see Deep Links section).

#### 4) Address Book + Labels

* Local labeling for wallets, delegates, programs, validators, mints, DAOs, and safe destinations.
* Auto-suggests addresses discovered from wallet holdings and authorities.
* Import/export JSON for team sharing.

#### 5) Delegate Explorer

* Groups and resolves delegate addresses found on token accounts.
* Classifies resolved accounts (wallet/system, token account, stake account, executable program, PDA-like, etc.).
* Shows owner program, balance, and account data size.
* Includes Explorer links per delegate and owner program.

#### 6) Signer + Authority Map

Builds a relationship map from the connected signer to:

* Token delegates
* Token close authorities
* Mint/freeze authorities
* Stake authorities (staker/withdrawer)
* Upgradeable loader buffer authorities

#### 7) Staking

* Native stake program operations:
  * Create + delegate stake
  * Deactivate stake
  * Withdraw stake
* Stake discovery uses Shyft when available, with RPC fallback.
* Program ID is adapter-driven:
  * Native program works now
  * Custom program IDs are accepted for future adapters

#### 8) Signature Decoder

Decode paths:

* From on-chain transaction signature
* From serialized base64 transaction payload

Outputs:

* Decoded instructions
* Program labeling
* Logs and simulation errors
* Risk flags

Optional enrichment:

* Calls `/api/helius/transactions?signature=...` for enhanced summary when server key is configured.

#### 9) Rent Recovery Sweeper

* Finds empty token accounts.
* Multi-select close operations.
* Batches close instructions.
* Estimates recovered SOL and transaction count before submit.

#### 10) Program Buffers

* Discovers upgradeable loader buffers by authority.
* Shows buffer size and lamports.
* Supports closing buffers to a selected recipient (authority must match connected wallet).

#### 11) Claim Round Manager

Local claim-round control plane with:

* Lifecycle tracking (`draft` -> `manifest-ready` -> `active` -> `ended` -> `clawback` -> `archived`)
* Index policy management (`round-offset-row`, `global-sequential`, `manual`)
* Root history versioning
* Governance metadata
* Start/end/clawback timing
* Overlap warnings
* Import/export JSON
* Copy-ready claim URLs and policy JSON

#### 12) Holdings

* Shows SOL balance, token accounts, and token/NFT metadata.
* Includes mint-level details:
  * Supply
  * Mint authority
  * Freeze authority
  * Initialization status
* Fetches Metaplex metadata and JSON metadata when available.
* Media rendering can be toggled on/off.
* Public route `/identity/[publickey]` uses this panel in read-only target-address mode.

#### 13) Jupiter Swap Router (Optional)

* Visible only when `NEXT_JUP_API_KEY` is configured.
* Routed through server-side proxy endpoints:
  * `GET /api/jupiter/quote`
  * `POST /api/jupiter/swap`

### Deep Links

Identity supports `?action=` routing for direct entry into specific tools.

| Query                                               | Opens                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `?action=revoke`                                    | Approval Risk Scanner            |
| `?action=labels` or `?action=address-book`          | Address Book + Labels            |
| `?action=claim-rounds` / `rounds` / `claim-manager` | Claim Round Manager              |
| `?action=sweep`                                     | Incident Response Mode           |
| `?action=stake` or `?action=staking`                | Staking                          |
| `?action=swap` / `swap-router` / `jupiter`          | Jupiter Swap Router (if enabled) |

Incident sweep deep link params:

* `safeWallet=<PUBKEY>`
* `reserveSol=<number>`

Example:

```
/identity?action=sweep&safeWallet=<PUBKEY>&reserveSol=0.02
```

### Power API (Automation)

Identity exposes plan/snapshot endpoints for scripted workflows.

#### `GET /api/power/holdings`

Query:

* `owner` (required)
* `rpcEndpoint` (optional)

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "snapshot": {
    "owner": "<PUBKEY>",
    "rpcEndpoint": "<URL>",
    "solLamports": 0,
    "sol": 0,
    "tokenAccounts": [],
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

#### `POST /api/power/revoke-plan`

Body:

```json
{
  "owner": "<PUBKEY>",
  "rpcEndpoint": "<OPTIONAL_URL>",
  "maxInstructionsPerTx": 8
}
```

Returns serialized revoke instruction batches and summary metadata.

#### `POST /api/power/sweep-plan`

Body:

```json
{
  "owner": "<PUBKEY>",
  "safeWallet": "<PUBKEY>",
  "reserveSol": 0.02,
  "rpcEndpoint": "<OPTIONAL_URL>",
  "maxInstructionsPerTx": 6
}
```

Returns serialized token+SOL sweep batches, warnings, and summary metadata.

### CLI Wrapper

```bash
npm run power:cli -- holdings --owner <PUBKEY>
npm run power:cli -- revoke-plan --owner <PUBKEY> --batch-size 8
npm run power:cli -- sweep-plan --owner <PUBKEY> --safe-wallet <PUBKEY> --reserve-sol 0.02
```

Optional:

* `--rpc-endpoint <URL>`
* `--base-url <URL>`
* `--json`

### Environment Variables (Identity)

* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_DEFAULT_RPC_URL`
  * Default RPC endpoint for wallet connections.
* `NEXT_HELIUS_API_KEY`
  * Enables Helius enhanced transaction enrichment in Signature Decoder.
* `NEXT_JUP_API_KEY`
  * Enables Jupiter Swap Router and proxy routes.

Notes:

* Shyft-based enrichments (staking/holdings API helpers) are available when the selected RPC endpoint is a `shyft.to` URL with an `api_key` query parameter.
* RPC endpoint and security policy selections are persisted locally in the browser.
