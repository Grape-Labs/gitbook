# About

Grape Solana Program Library is designed to facillitate the standardized storage and retrieval of DAO metadata on Solana. Its purpose is to bring transparency, efficiency and consistency to the way DAO information is managed and accessed.&#x20;

1 - **Problem:** Previously, DAO metadata was often maintained n offline documents, leading to issues with accessibility, transparancy and data integrity.&#x20;

2 - **Need & Solution** : To improve, accessibility and trustworthiness of DAO information. GSPL adresses this by creating a standardized framework for DAOs to store their metadata directly on chain, ensuring the data is up to date, secure and publicly verifiable.

3 - **Implementation:** The program uses a standardized format for data entry, ensuring consistency accross different DAOs

4 - **Brief functionality:** Metadata Standardization, On Chain Storage, Easy Data Access. 

5 - **Use Cases:** Verification, Interoperability, dynamic customization
